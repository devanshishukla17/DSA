/*
there are two nodes in multilist-header node and data node
top most are column headers 
left most are  row headers
there is usage of singly circular linked list in the multilist

multilist is a data structure where elements are connected in more than one dimension or direction. 

nodes with multiple links.each node can have pointers in different directions

efficient access and storage-efficient for storing sparese matrix,where most elements are zero. 
they only store non zero elements hence saving space.

-------------------HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM-------------------------------
when I give 1 for doctor- one column header is added.
when I give 2 patient id 1 is created and onw row header is created.
